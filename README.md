# KNN - K-Nearest Neighbors
Implementation of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm in python. Classifies input based on already classified training data based on the k closest training samples to the input.

## Usage
To run a simple test just ```python3 KNN.py```. 



To run with own input, import into your own work!

```from KNN import knn .... knn(TRAINING_DATA, LABELS_FOR_TRAINING_DATA, K_NUM_NEIGHBORS, PREDICT_LIST)```. knn() will return a tuple of the points the user wants to classify; ```PREDICT_LIST```, and the labels for the ```PREDICT_LIST```. 

Must have numpy installed.
